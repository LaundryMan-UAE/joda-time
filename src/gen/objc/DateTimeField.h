 @brief Defines the calculation engine for date and time fields.
 The interface defines a set of methods that manipulate a millisecond datetime with regards to a single field, such as monthOfYear or secondOfMinute. <p> This design is extensible so, if you wish, you can extract a different field from the milliseconds. A number of standard implementations are provided to assist.
