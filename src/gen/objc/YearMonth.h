/**
 @brief YearMonth is an immutable partial supporting the year and monthOfYear fields.
 <p> NOTE: This class only supports the two fields listed above. It is impossible to query any other fields, such as dayOfWeek or centuryOfEra. <p> Calculations on YearMonth are performed using a Chronology . This chronology is set to be in the UTC time zone for all calculations. <p> One use case for this class is to store a credit card expiry date, as that only references the year and month. This class can be used as the gYearMonth type in XML Schema. <p> Each individual field can be queried in two ways: <ul> <li><code>getMonthOfYear()</code> <li><code>monthOfYear().get()</code> </ul> The second technique also provides access to other useful methods on the field: <ul> <li>numeric value - <code>monthOfYear().get()</code> <li>text value - <code>monthOfYear().getAsText()</code> <li>short text value - <code>monthOfYear().getAsShortText()</code> <li>maximum/minimum values - <code>monthOfYear().getMaximumValue()</code> <li>add/subtract - <code>monthOfYear().addToCopy()</code> <li>set - <code>monthOfYear().setCopy()</code> </ul> <p> YearMonth is thread-safe and immutable, provided that the Chronology is as well. All standard Chronology classes supplied are thread-safe and immutable.
