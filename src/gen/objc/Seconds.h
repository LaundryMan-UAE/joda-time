/**
 @brief An immutable time period representing a number of seconds.
 <p> <code>Seconds</code> is an immutable period that can only store seconds. It does not store years, months or hours for example. As such it is a type-safe way of representing a number of seconds in an application. <p> The number of seconds is set in the constructor, and may be queried using <code>getSeconds()</code>. Basic mathematical operations are provided - <code>plus()</code>, <code>minus()</code>, <code>multipliedBy()</code> and <code>dividedBy()</code>. <p> <code>Seconds</code> is thread-safe and immutable.
