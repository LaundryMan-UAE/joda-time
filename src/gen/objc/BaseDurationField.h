 @brief BaseDurationField provides the common behaviour for DurationField implementations.
 <p> This class should generally not be used directly by API users. The DurationField class should be used when different kinds of DurationField objects are to be referenced. <p> BaseDurationField is thread-safe and immutable, and its subclasses must be as well.
