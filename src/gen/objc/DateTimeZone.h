/**
 @brief DateTimeZone represents a time zone.
 <p> A time zone is a system of rules to convert time from one geographic location to another. For example, Paris, France is one hour ahead of London, England. Thus when it is 10:00 in London, it is 11:00 in Paris. <p> All time zone rules are expressed, for historical reasons, relative to Greenwich, London. Local time in Greenwich is referred to as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  This is similar, but not precisely identical, to Universal Coordinated Time, or UTC. This library only uses the term UTC. <p> Using this system, America/Los_Angeles is expressed as UTC-08:00, or UTC-07:00 in the summer. The offset -08:00 indicates that America/Los_Angeles time is obtained from UTC by adding -08:00, that is, by subtracting 8 hours. <p> The offset differs in the summer because of daylight saving time, or DST. The following definitions of time are generally used: <ul> <li>UTC - The reference time. <li>Standard Time - The local time without a daylight saving time offset. For example, in Paris, standard time is UTC+01:00. <li>Daylight Saving Time - The local time with a daylight saving time offset. This offset is typically one hour, but not always. It is typically used in most countries away from the equator.  In Paris, daylight saving time is UTC+02:00. <li>Wall Time - This is what a local clock on the wall reads. This will be either Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time depending on the time of year and whether the location uses Daylight Saving Time. </ul> <p> Unlike the Java TimeZone class, DateTimeZone is immutable. It also only supports long format time zone ids. Thus EST and ECT are not accepted. However, the factory that accepts a TimeZone will attempt to convert from the old short id to a suitable long id. <p> DateTimeZone is thread-safe and immutable, and all subclasses must be as well.
