 @brief An immutable duration specifying a length of time in milliseconds.
 <p> A duration is defined by a fixed number of milliseconds. There is no concept of fields, such as days or seconds, as these fields can vary in length. <p> A duration may be converted to a Period to obtain field values. This conversion will typically cause a loss of precision. <p> Duration is thread-safe and immutable.
