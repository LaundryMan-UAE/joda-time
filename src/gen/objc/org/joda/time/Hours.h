 @brief An immutable time period representing a number of hours.
 <p>
 <code>Hours</code> is an immutable period that can only store hours.
 It does not store years, months or minutes for example. As such it is a
 type-safe way of representing a number of hours in an application.
 <p>
 The number of hours is set in the constructor, and may be queried using
 <code>getHours()</code>. Basic mathematical operations are provided -
 <code>plus()</code>, <code>minus()</code>, <code>multipliedBy()</code> and
 <code>dividedBy()</code>.
 <p>
 <code>Hours</code> is thread-safe and immutable.
