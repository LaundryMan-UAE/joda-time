/*!
 @brief LocalDate is an immutable datetime class representing a date
  without a time zone.
 <p>
  LocalDate implements the <code>ReadablePartial</code> interface.
  To do this, the interface methods focus on the key fields -
  Year, MonthOfYear and DayOfMonth.
  However, <b>all</b> date fields may in fact be queried. 
 <p>
  LocalDate differs from DateMidnight in that this class does not
  have a time zone and does not represent a single instant in time. 
 <p>
  Calculations on LocalDate are performed using a <code>Chronology</code>.
  This chronology will be set internally to be in the UTC time zone
  for all calculations. 
 <p>Each individual field can be queried in two ways: 
 <ul>
  <li><code>getMonthOfYear()</code>
  <li><code>monthOfYear().get()</code>
  </ul>
  The second technique also provides access to other useful methods on the
  field: 
 <ul>
  <li>numeric value 
 <li>text value 
 <li>short text value 
 <li>maximum/minimum values 
 <li>add/subtract
  <li>set
  <li>rounding
  </ul>
  
 <p>
  LocalDate is thread-safe and immutable, provided that the Chronology is as well.
  All standard Chronology classes supplied are thread-safe and immutable.

 @brief LocalDate.Property binds a LocalDate to a DateTimeField allowing
  powerful datetime functionality to be easily accessed.
 <p>
  The simplest use of this class is as an alternative get method, here used to
  get the year '1972' (as an int) and the month 'December' (as a String). 
 @code

  LocalDate dt = new LocalDate(1972, 12, 3, 0, 0);
  int year = dt.year().get();
  String monthStr = dt.month().getAsText(); 
  
@endcode
  <p>
  Methods are also provided that allow date modification. These return
  new instances of LocalDate - they do not modify the original. The example
  below yields two independent immutable date objects 20 years apart. 
 @code

  LocalDate dt = new LocalDate(1972, 12, 3);
  LocalDate dt1920 = dt.year().setCopy(1920);
