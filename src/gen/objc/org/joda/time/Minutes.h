 @brief An immutable time period representing a number of minutes.
 <p>
  <code>Minutes</code> is an immutable period that can only store minutes.
  It does not store years, months or hours for example. As such it is a
  type-safe way of representing a number of minutes in an application. 
 <p>
  The number of minutes is set in the constructor, and may be queried using 
 <code>getMinutes()</code>. Basic mathematical operations are provided - 
 <code>plus()</code>, <code>minus()</code>, <code>multipliedBy()</code> and 
 <code>dividedBy()</code>.
  <p>
  <code>Minutes</code> is thread-safe and immutable.
