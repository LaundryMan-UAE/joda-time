 @brief BaseDurationField provides the common behaviour for DurationField
  implementations.
 <p>
  This class should generally not be used directly by API users. The
  DurationField class should be used when different kinds of DurationField
  objects are to be referenced. 
 <p>
  BaseDurationField is thread-safe and immutable, and its subclasses must
  be as well.
