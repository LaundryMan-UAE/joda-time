/*!
 @brief Defines a time period specified in terms of individual duration fields
 such as years and days.
 <p>
 The implementation of this interface may be mutable or immutable. This
 interface only gives access to retrieve data, never to change it.
 <p>
 Periods are split up into multiple fields, for example days and seconds.
 Implementations are not required to evenly distribute the values across the fields.
 The value for each field may be positive or negative.
 <p>
 When a time period is added to an instant, the effect is to add each field in turn.
 For example, a time period could be defined as 3 months, 2 days and -1 hours.
 In most circumstances this would be the same as 3 months, 1 day, and 23 hours.
 However, when adding across a daylight savings boundary, a day may be 23 or 25 hours long.
 Thus, the time period is always added field by field to the datetime.
 <p>
 Periods are independent of chronology, and can only be treated as durations
 when paired with a time via an interval.

 Note that a period of 1 day is not equal to a period of 24 hours,

 This is because periods represent an abstracted definition of a time
 period (eg. a day may not actually be 24 hours, it might be 23 or 25
 at daylight savings boundary).

 To compare the actual duration of two periods, convert both to
 <code>Duration</code>s, an operation that emphasises that the result may
 differ according to the date you choose.
