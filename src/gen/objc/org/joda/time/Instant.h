/**
 @brief Instant is the standard implementation of a fully immutable instant in time.
 <p> <code>Instant</code> is an implementation of ReadableInstant . As with all instants, it represents an exact point on the time-line, but limited to the precision of milliseconds. An <code>Instant</code> should be used to represent a point in time irrespective of any other factor, such as chronology or time zone. <p> Internally, the class holds one piece of data, the instant as milliseconds from the Java epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. <p> For example, an Instant can be used to compare two <code>DateTime</code> objects irrespective of chronology or time zone. <pre> boolean sameInstant = dt1.toInstant().equals(dt2.toInstant()); </pre> Note that the following code will also perform the same check: <pre> boolean sameInstant = dt1.isEqual(dt2); </pre> <p> Instant is thread-safe and immutable.
