/**
 @brief Defines an exact duration of time in milliseconds.
 <p> The implementation of this interface may be mutable or immutable. This interface only gives access to retrieve data, never to change it. <p> Methods that are passed a duration as a parameter will treat <code>null</code> as a zero length duration. <p> The <code>compareTo</code> method is no longer defined in this class in version 2.0. Instead, the definition is simply inherited from the <code>Comparable</code> interface. This approach is necessary to preserve binary compatibility. The definition of the comparison is ascending order by millisecond duration. Implementors are recommended to extend <code>AbstractInstant</code> instead of this interface.

If the duration is larger than one day then all the remaining duration will be stored in the largest available field, hours in this case. <p> For example, a duration effectively equal to (365 + 60 + 5) days will be converted to ((365 + 60 + 5) * 24) hours by this constructor. <p> For more control over the conversion process, you must pair the duration with an instant, see Period#Period(ReadableInstant,ReadableDuration) .
