 @brief AbstractDuration provides the common behaviour for duration classes.
 <p> This class should generally not be used directly by API users. The ReadableDuration interface should be used when different kinds of durations are to be referenced. <p> AbstractDuration subclasses may be mutable and not thread-safe.

If the duration is larger than one day then all the remaining duration will be stored in the largest available field, hours in this case. <p> For example, a duration effectively equal to (365 + 60 + 5) days will be converted to ((365 + 60 + 5) * 24) hours by this constructor. <p> For more control over the conversion process, you must pair the duration with an instant, see Period#Period(ReadableInstant,ReadableDuration) .
